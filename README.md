Hi, 

I spend my working days designing and programming wearables. 
Outside of work I enjoy playing Hearthstone Battlegrounds. 
Any project on here is an idea I had or project I wanted to help out. 
IF you think you have aa open source project that I would be interested, feel free to send me a message :)

Quinn
